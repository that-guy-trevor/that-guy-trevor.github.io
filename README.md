## Get All Permutations of an Array

This Github Page provides a visual illustration of how recursive backtracking operates, with a particular focus on solving <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations">Leetcode 46: Permutations</a>. It demonstrates step-by-step how the algorithm explores different possibilities, backtracks to previous states, and constructs all valid permutations. The solution is implemented in Python 3, so hopefully it will be easy to follow and understand the underlying logic. Whether you're a beginner trying to grasp the concept or an experienced coder looking for a clear example, this visualization aims to enhance your understanding of recursive backtracking techniques and their application to the permutation problem.

### Development 

The website is developed using HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript. It incorporates three open-source libraries to enhance animations and styling, alongside a custom "micro-jQuery" function I created to reduce repetitive code, such as multiple instances of "document.getElementById" — adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. The overall design of the page is heavily influenced by <a href="https://try.codeaesthetic.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code Aesthetic</a> and various other visual coding tools.

### Bugs or Glitches

I am currently working on refining the "Prev" and "Next" functions. Occasionally, depending on your current step, they may not behave as expected, requiring a page reset. There may also be other bugs I haven't encountered yet. Please feel free to open a pull request or submit an issue to notify me of any problems or suggestions.

### Future Plans

Currently, the entire coding interface is built with hard-coded HTML and CSS. However, I plan to integrate an editor like CodeMirror, Ace, TinyMCE, or Prism to handle features such as syntax highlighting and code coloring, which would significantly reduce manual effort. Additionally, I am developing a system to utilize configuration files, allowing the interface and guided coding steps to follow a structured format. This approach will make it easier to add new examples and expand the functionality in the future. I have several other features in development, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself just yet :)
